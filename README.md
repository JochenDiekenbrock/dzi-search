donation certificate ("Spendensiegel") of the
[DZI (Deutsches Zentralinstitut f√ºr soziale Fragen)](https://www.dzi.de)

**Sample data is provided in the repository. Please note that this data will probably be outdated!**

### Scraping new organization data

**Scraped data is cached locally. To fetch the most recent data, make sure that DATA/temp is empty!**

run `npm run scrape` to regenerate the organization data in 
public/DATA/organizations.json

intermediate scraping results are stored in DATA/temp and new data is only 
scraped for data items that are not found in DATA/temp to avoid scraping 
data needlessly again and again.
